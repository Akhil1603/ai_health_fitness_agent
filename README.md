# 🤖 AI Health & Fitness Planner Agent – Your Personal Trainer Who Never Sleeps 🏋️‍♀️🥗

Welcome to the **AI Health & Fitness Planner Agent**, your friendly neighborhood health guru—except it doesn’t judge your snack choices, works 24/7, and runs on Python instead of protein shakes.

Powered by the **Agno AI Agent framework**, this app is your ticket to personalized health nirvana. Whether you're bulking, shredding, flexing, or just trying to survive Mondays, our dual-agent system’s got your back (and your abs).

## 💡 Features – Because You Deserve a Plan That Understands You

### 🧠 Health Agent & 💪 Fitness Agent

Two agents, one mission: **optimize your life**. One deals with diet. The other with sweat. Together, they’re basically your digital wellness Avengers.

---

### 🥦 Personalized Dietary Plans:

* Tailored meal plans for **breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks** (yes, snacks count too).
* Tracks hydration, fiber, electrolytes — basically all the things you pretend to care about during health checkups.
* Supports all the fancy diets: **Keto, Low Carb, Vegetarian**, or "just trying not to eat like a raccoon."

---

### 🏃‍♂️ Personalized Fitness Routines:

* Workouts customized to your goals (from couch potato to Greek god).
* Includes **warm-ups, cooldowns**, and the occasional motivational nudge.
* Fitness tips you can actually use (no bro-science here).

---

### 💬 Interactive Q\&A:

* Confused about carbs? Scared of squats? Ask away.
* The agents love chatting more than your gym buddy who never actually lifts.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements – AKA What the Agent Eats

You’ll need these Python packages to keep the agents alive and kicking:

* `agno`
* `google-generativeai`
* `streamlit`

Just run the `requirements.txt` and let pip do the cooking.
